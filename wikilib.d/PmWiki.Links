text=(:Summary:Linking within and between wiki pages:)%0a(:Audience: authors (basic) :)%0aA key feature of [[Wiki Wiki Web]]s is the ease of creating %25newwin%25[[Wikipedia:Hyperlink|hyper links]]%25%25 in the text of a document.  %0aPmWiki provides multiple mechanisms for creating such links.%0a%0a!! Links to other pages in the wiki%0a%0aTo create a link to another page, simply enclose the name of the page inside double square brackets, as in [@[[wiki sandbox]]@] or [@[[installation]]@].  These result in links to [[wiki sandbox]] and [[installation]], respectively.%0a%0aPmWiki creates a link by using the text inside the double brackets. It does this by removing spaces between words, and automatically capitalizing words following spaces or other punctuation (like ~). Thus [@[[Wiki sandbox]]@], [@[[wiki sandbox]]@], and [@[[WikiSandbox]]@] all display differently but create the same link to the page titled ''WikiSandbox''.%0a%0aIn other words, PmWiki will automatically create the link path name using title case as a rule, but link text will display in the format you have entered it.%0a%0aA suffix can also be added to the end of a link, which becomes part of the link text but not the target.  Thus [@[[wiki sandbox]]es@] is a link to ''[=WikiSandbox=]'' but displays as [[wiki sandbox]]es.%0a%0aLink text in (parentheses) will not be not displayed, so that [@[[(wiki) sandbox]]@] links to ''[=WikiSandbox=]'' and displays as [[(wiki) sandbox]].%0a%0aFinally, you can specify the link text via a vertical brace, thus  [@[[WikiSandbox | a play area]]@], which links to ''WikiSandbox'' but displays as [[WikiSandbox | a play area]].  You can use an arrow ([@->@]) to reverse the order of the text and target, as in [@[[a play area -> WikiSandbox]]@]  ([[a play area -> WikiSandbox]]).%0a%0aSome sites also recognize [[WikiWord]] links, in which a camel case (capitalised) ''[=WikiWord=]'' appearing in the text is automatically treated as a link to a page of the same name.%0a%0a!!! [[#linkshortcuts]]Link shortcuts%0a%0aUse of special characters in title is not a problem for PmWiki, but sometimes the character set is different from your computer and the server computer or the client computer that is used to read your wiki. Specially UTF-8 gives some problems. So it's better not to use these and keep ASCII characters if possible. Any page can have a [=(:title %3cname>:)=] directive to display a localized title instead of the page file name. In this case, the following tip is important and usefull.%0a%0a'''[@[[PageName|+]]@]''' creates a link to PageName and uses that page's title as the link text, e.g., [=[[PmWiki.BasicEditing|+]]=] where the page BasicEditing has the directive [=(:title=] {BasicEditing$Title}:) gives [[PmWiki.BasicEditing|+]].  %0a%0a%0a'''[@[[PageName|#]]@]''' creates a [[#reference|reference]] link as shown below'^[[#reference|#]]^'.%0a%0a'''[@[[!PageName]]@]''' creates a link to the PageName in the group called Category. See [[PmWiki/Categories]].%0a%0a'''[@[[~Author]]@]''' link creates a link to the page called Author in the Profiles group.  %0a%0a'''[@~@][@~~@]''' markup creates a link for the current Author when it encounters three tilde characters ([@~@]) in a row ([@~@][@~@][@~@]).  %0a%0a'''[@~~@][@~~@]''' markup creates a link for the current author and appends the current date and time when four tilde characters ([@~@]) in a row are encountered%0a%0a!!! [[#anchors]]Links to specific locations within a page -- "anchors"%0a%0aTo define a location within a page to which you may jump directly, use the markup [@[[#name]]@].  This creates an "anchor" that uniquely identifies that location in the page.  Then to have a link jump directly to that anchor, use one of%0a%0a* [@[[#name|link text]]@] within the same page, or%0a* [@[[PageName#name]]@] or [@[[PageName#name|link text]]@] for a location on another page%0a* The form [@[[PageName(#name)]]@] may be useful for hiding the anchor text in a link. %0a%0aFor example, here's a link to the [[#intermaps | Intermaps]] section, below. %0a%0aNotes:%0a* %25red%25the anchor itself must begin with a letter%25%25, '''not a number'''%0a* a link to an anchor must have the '''same capitalization as the anchor''' itself. %0a* Spaces are not allowed in an anchor:  "[@[[#my anchor]]@]" won't work,  "[@[[#myanchor]]@]" will.%0a%0a!!! [[#actions]]Links to actions%0a%0aTo link to a specific action for the current page use [@[[{$FullName}?action=actionname|linkname]]@].%0a%0aExamples:%0a* [@[[{$FullName}?action=edit|Edit]]@] for the editing or%0a* [@[[{$FullName}?action=diff|differences]]@] for differences.%0a%0a!! Links outside the wiki%0a[[#externallinks]]%0a!!! Links to external sites ([=URLs=])%0a%0aLinks to external sites simply begin with a prefix such as 'http:', 'ftp:', etc.  Thus [@http://google.com/@] and [@[[http://google.com/]]@] both link to Google.  As with the above, an author can specify the link text by using the vertical brace or arrow syntax, as in [@[[http://google.com/ | Google]]@] and [@[[Google -> http://google.com]]@].%0a%0aIf the external link includes (parentheses), escape these using [=%2528=] for "(" and [=%2529=] for ")" : %0a(:markup:)[=[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_%2528disambiguation%2529 | link to "Wiki (disambiguation)" ]]=]%0a%0a!!! Links to intranet (local) files%0a%0aYou can link to a file system by including the prefix [@'file:///'@] (for Internet Explorer at least). So [@file:///S:\ProjPlan.mpp@] and [@[[Shared S drive->file:///S:\]]@] are both valid links. On a Windows file system you may want to use network locations (eg \\server1\rootdirectory\subdirectory) rather than drive letters which may not be consistent across all users. Not all browsers will follow such links.%0a%0a!! Link characteristics%0a!!! [[#reference]]Links as References%0a%0aLinks may also be specified as '''References''', so the target appears as an anonymous ''numeric'' reference rather than a ''textual'' reference. The following markup is provided to produce sequential reference numbering within a PmWiki page:%0a%0aFormatting the link as: [@[[http://google.com |#]]@] produces: [[http://google.com |#]] as the link.%0a%0aSubsequent occurrence of the reference link format on the same page will be incremented automatically as per the following example: Entering [@[[http://pmwiki.com |#]]@] produces [[http://pmwiki.com |#]], [@[[#intermaps |#]]@] produces [[#intermaps |#]], and so on for further reference links.%0a%0a!!! [[#intermaps]]Intermaps%0a%0a[[Inter Map]] links are also supported (see [[Inter Map]]).  In particular, the [@Path:@] InterMap entry can be used to create links using relative or absolute paths on the current site (e.g., [@Path:../../somedir/foo.html@] or [@Path:/dir/something.gif@]).%0a%0a%0a!!! Links to pages in other [[wiki group]]s%0a%0aSee [[Wiki Group]].%0a%0a!!! Links that open a new browser window%0a%0aTo have a link open in another window, use [@%25newwin%25...%25%25@]:%0a%0a* [@%25newwin%25  http://pmichaud.com %25%25@] produces %25newwin%25  http://pmichaud.com %25%25%0a* [@%25newwin%25 [[http://google.com/ | Google]] %25%25@] produces %25newwin%25 [[http://google.com/ | Google]]%25%25%0a* [@%25newwin%25 [[Main.WikiSandbox]] %25%25@] produces %25newwin%25  [[Main.WikiSandbox]]%25%25%0a%0aYou can also specify that links should open in a new window via the @@[=%25target=_blank%25...%25%25=]@@ attribute:%0a%0a(:markup class=horiz:)%0aThe following link %25target=_blank%25 http://pmichaud.com %25%25%0awill open in a new window.%0a(:markupend:)%0a%0a!!! [[#robots]]Links that are not followed by [[(PmWiki:)robots]]%0a%0aPrefix a link with [=%25rel=nofollow%25=] to advise %25newwin rel=nofollow%25[[http://robotstxt.org/|robots]] and [[http://validator.w3.org/checklink|link checkers]]%25%25 not to follow it.%0a%0a%0a!! Links and CSS Classes%0a%0aPmWiki automatically gives classes to several types of links. Among other things, this enables you to format each type differently.%0a%0aNote: This may be an incomplete list.%0a:.selflink:A link to the current page. Useful in sidebars to show "you are here".%0a:.wikilink:A link to another page within the wiki.%0a:.urllink:A link to a page outside the wiki.%0a%0a!! Notes%0a%0a'''Note:''' The default behavior of "+" above can be overridden to display the spaced title, rather than simply the title by adding the following to config.php:%0a->[@%0a## [[target |+]] title links%0aMarkup('[[|+', '%3c[[|',%0a  "/(?>\\[\\[([^|\\]]+))\\|\\s*\\+\\s*]]/e",%0a  "Keep(MakeLink(\$pagename, PSS('$1'),%0a                 PageVar(MakePageName(\$pagename,PSS('$1')), '\$Titlespaced')%0a                ),'L')");%0a@]%0a%0a%0a>>faq%3c%3c [[#faq]]%0a%0aQ: How do I create a link that will open as a new window?%0a%0aA: Use the [@%25newwin%25@] wikistyle, as in:%0a(:markup class=horiz:) [=%25newwin%25 http://example.com/ %25%25=]%0a%0aQ: How do I create a link that will open a new window, and configure that new window?%0a%0aA: This requires javascript.
