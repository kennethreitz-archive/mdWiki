text=(:Summary:PmWiki's default [[PmWiki/InterMap]] links, and how to can create additional InterMap links:)%0a(:title Custom InterMap:)%0a(:Audience: administrator (intermediate) :)%0a%0aThis page describes PmWiki's default [[InterMap]] links, and how a [[wiki administrator]] can create additional InterMap links.%0a%0aAn intermap entry takes the following format:%0a%0a-> [@%0aMapPrefix:      http://example.com/partial/url/%0a@]%0a%0aThe InterMap entry can be for any of the [[(PmWiki:)link schemes]] supported by PmWiki.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0aYou can create your own InterMap links by doing one or more of the following:%0a%0a* Modify the page called ''[[{$SiteGroup}.InterMap]]'' and place entries like the ones above in it.%0a* Create a file called ''local/localmap.txt'' and place entries like the%0a  ones above in it.%0a* In a [[WikiFarm(s)]] installation you can create a file called%0a  ''local/farmmap.txt'' and there place entries like the ones above in it.%0a  These prefixes will be common to all the wikis in the farm.%0a* Ensure that there is a space after the colon%0a%0aDo not edit the file ''scripts/intermap.txt'' directly!  If you do, you'll%0alose your changes when you [[PmWiki/upgrade(s)]] PmWiki.%0a%0a%0a!! Variables and InterMap links%0a%0aIt's possible to use variables within your InterMap entries.  The following%0aentries create [@ThisWiki:@] and [@ThisPage:@] shortcuts:%0a%0a-> [@%0aThisWiki:        $ScriptUrl%0aThisPage:        {$PageUrl}%0a@]%0a%0aYou can also define InterMap entries where the text of the entry is%0asubstituted into the middle of the URL.  Just include '$1' in the URL where%0ayou want the substitution to take place.  For example:%0a%0a->[@Jargon:          http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/$1.html@]%0a%0awould cause [@Jargon:F/feature-creep@] to be converted to [@http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/F/feature-creep.html@].%0a%0a%0a!! Tips and tricks%0a%0aIt is possible to document your intermap prefixes directly in the page%0a[[Site.InterMap]]. The extra text will not cause a performance penalty, nor%0awill it break the definition of prefixes. However, be aware that anything%0amatching a line starting with a word and a colon (''':''') will be%0aconsidered to define a prefix.%0a%0aThe order in which various sources are checked for definitions of prefixes%0ais controlled by the variable $InterMapFiles. Currently the precedence%0a(highest to lowest is as follows):%0a* ''local/localmap.txt''%0a* ''$SiteGroup.InterMap''%0a* ''$FarmD/local/farmmap.txt''%0a* ''$FarmD/scripts/intermap.txt''%0a%0a!!
